    <p>
      The UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) is the central hub for the
      collection of functional information on proteins, with accurate,
      consistent and rich annotation. In addition to capturing the core data
      mandatory for each UniProtKB entry (mainly, the amino acid sequence,
      protein name or description, taxonomic data and citation information), as
      much annotation information as possible is added.
    </p>
    <p>UniProtKB consists of two sections:</p>
    <p>
      Reviewed (Swiss-Prot) - Manually annotated Records with information
      extracted from literature and curator-evaluated computational analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unreviewed (TrEMBL) - Computationally analyzed Records that await full
      manual annotation.
